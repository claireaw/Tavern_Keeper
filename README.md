A quick bot originally made over a weekend. This is a sanitized version of a similar bot being built for an organization.

<h1>Tavern Keeper: A Guide</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is a quick guide to the operations of the Tavern Keeper Discord bot. This will cover how each of the commands work, and each of their use cases.

<h2>Setup</h2>
This command sets up a user in the database. Each user is prompted to enter a specific username. A user who already exists in the system but tries to register will recieve a message alerting them to the fact.

Users who abuse this can have their name altered or be removed from the system altogether.

<h2>TODO</h2>
   * <s>Fix bug related to purchasing items</s>
   * <s>Clean up output to be more human-readable</s>
   * <s>Ensure close to 100% uptime for project</s>
   * Improve purchasing method to discourage nested statements
   * Add refusal messages to a non-permissioned user requesting a permissioned command. Currently it just fails.
